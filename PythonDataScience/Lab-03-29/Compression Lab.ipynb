    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of compression is to represent a file using fewer bits. Compression was obviously very important many years ago when hard drive storage was measured in megabytes, not gigabytes or terabytes. But it remains relevant today in the age of small personal devices and big data. If the music on your phone were stored as uncompressed WAV files, you wouldn't be able to fit much music; fortunately, MP3 files are often about 10 times smaller. At the other extreme, even data centers that can store petabytes of data are struggling to keep up with satellites that are beaming terabytes of data back to Earth every second. Compression remains a relevant problem in the modern world.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of compression: lossy and lossless. Lossy compression is straightforward; to achieve a smaller file, we throw away some (hopefully less important) data. For example, MP3 leverages research on human psychoacoustics to discard frequencies that we wouldn't be able to hear anyway. On the other hand, lossless compression seems too good to be true. How can it be possible to achieve a smaller file without losing anything at all? We explore this question in this lab."

    "# ## Huffman Coding\n",
    "\n",
    "In a uniform coding scheme, we use an equal number of bits to represent \n",
    "every symbol. For example, if there were 5 symbols in our world, a uniform\n",
    "coding scheme might use a 3-bit code for each symbol:\n",
    "\n",
    "A | B | C | D | E \n",
    ":--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n",
    "000 | 001 | 010 | 011 | 100\n",
    "\n",
    "A table like this one that maps symbols to their codes is called a *codebook*.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not all symbols are equally common. Suppose the actual probabilities \n",
    "of each letter were\n",
    "\n",
    "A | B | C | D | E \n",
    ":--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n",
    ".05 | .15 | .20 | .25 | .35\n",
    "\n",
    "If we used a shorter code to represent E, maybe we could have a shorter \n",
    "text on average. Huffman coding does exactly this. It constructs a code for \n",
    "each symbol using the following algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the two symbols with the smallest probabilities. Add a 1 to \n",
    "the beginning of the code for one symbol and a 0 to \n",
    "the beginning of the code for the other. (So far, the code for A is \"1\" and \n",
    "the code for B is \"0\".)\n",
    "2. \"Merge\" those two symbols, and treat this merged symbol as a \n",
    "single symbol whose probability is the sum of the probabilities of the two \n",
    "symbols you merged. Repeat Steps \n",
    "1 and 2. (We now have a symbol AB whose probability is $.05 + .15 = .2$.\n",
    "The two symbols now with the smallest probabilities are now \n",
    "AB and C. So we prepend a 1 to the beginning of the codes for A and B \n",
    "and a 0 to the beginning of the code for C. So the code for A becomes \"11\", \n",
    "the code for B becomes \"10\", and the code for C becomes \"0\".)\n",
    "3. Repeat until all the symbols have been merged together.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check your understanding of Huffman coding, follow the instructions \n",
    "above and make sure you get a codebook that looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "A | B | C | D | E \n",
    ":--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:\n",
    "111 | 110 | 10 | 01 | 00\n",
    "\n",
    "(You might get something slightly different depending on which symbol you \n",
    "assigned a 1 to and which symbol you assigned a 0 to, at each step. As long as \n",
    "your codes are all of the same length, you should be okay.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $L$ represent the length of the code for a randomly chosen symbol. Under \n",
    "uniform coding, $L=3$. Under Huffman coding:\n",
    "$$ \\textrm{E}[L] = .05(3) + .15(3) + .2(2) + .25(2) + .35(2) = 2.4. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will implement a simple Huffman coder. The first function has been implemented for you. You will have to implement three others."
