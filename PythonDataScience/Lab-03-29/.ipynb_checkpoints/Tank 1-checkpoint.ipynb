The equation presented in to this document wont give volume readings for a head room beyond 95.5 inches. A head room reading of 95.5 inches or more is the last 78 Gallons of the tank that would need further analysis for a volume by height breakdown (Willing to do it if needed, didn't think realistically this type of reading would be done).\n"

    "The Equation for volume in gallons is broken down into two different types of shapes, a cylinder and a Conical Frustum.(http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConicalFrustum.html) <- if you're interested in what that is. There are some key values that you will see in the if conditionals in my code. Most of the you can see in the drawings, for exampe, you can clearly see that the height of the top cylinder in the tank is 12 inches. The most unintuitive one is the height of the conical frustrum, which I calculated as 6.6325 inches (someone else should verify this buy I'm like 95 % confident this is right)."
