    "## Question 2: Training a Markov Chain (30 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chains are mathematical systems that hop (a.k.a. \"transition\") randomly between various states. Please read [this visual explanation](http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/) for a high-level overview. The distinguishing feature of a Markov chain is that the next state only depends on which state the chain is in now; it doesn't depend on the past history of the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use Markov chains to model human language. Each word is a \"state\", and the next word in a sentence only depends on the current word, not any words that came before. This model makes sense because if we know that the current word is \"it\", the next word is very likely to be \"is\", less likely to be \"runs\", and never going to be \"pineapple\". On the other hand, if the current word is \"the\", then the next word might be \"pineapple\", but it can't be \"is\". The current word tells us a lot about what the next word might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a Markov chain model for the artist whose lyrics you scraped in Question 1. To do this, we have to go through the lyrics and learn the word transitions for that artist. We will store this information in a dict called `transitions`, which maps each word to a list of words that appear after it in the training data. So for example, one entry of this dict might be\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "transitions = {\n",
    "    \"it\": [\"is\", \"runs\", \"is\", \"is\", \"was\", \"is\", \"was\"],\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should include a few additional states, besides words, in your Markov chain. You should have `\"<START>\"` and `\"<END>\"` states so that we can keep track of what words songs are likely to begin and end on.  So if the song starts on the word \"it\" and ends with the word \"me.\", you would have \n",
    "```\n",
    "transitions = {\n",
    "    \"<START>\": [\"it\", ...],\n",

    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",

    "You should also include a state called `\"<N>\"` to denote line breaks so that we know where lines begin and end."
